# Agentic Insurance RAG — Decisions

The decisions this project is built on, and the reasoning behind each. Build steps live
separately. Corpus and access findings: `docs/sourceMap.md`.
Spec: `docs/agentic_insurance_rag_spec.pdf` (v2).

## Locked decisions

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Corpus | Ontario **auto only** — e-Laws HTML backbone + hand-downloaded FSRA policy forms | Auto has a *regulator-published* standard policy (OAP 1). Home does not — see Deviation 1. |
| Storage | **One Postgres 16** — pgvector + tsvector/GIN | Chunk text, embeddings, and full-text index in one store. "One Postgres over a vector DB plus a search engine" is a real architecture answer. |
| Ingestion | e-Laws pre-render (HTML) + PyMuPDF (PDF) | Two dialects, one chunk schema. |
| Agent | LangGraph, exclusion check as a **graph edge** | If the model can skip the exclusion check, eventually it will. |
| Retrieval | **Two bi-encoders; eval picks the winner** — `Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B` vs `bge-m3`, each with its own family cross-encoder | Both run locally, so no API key is needed to reproduce the table. Published scores disagree, and neither was measured on regulation text — see Deviation 8. |
| Eval order | Golden set **before** any retrieval code | Written after, it tests what you happened to build. |
| Gold labels | Clause **locators**, resolved to chunk IDs at eval time | Survives re-chunking, the agent, and corpus growth. |

## Open decisions

**Deployment target — Azure Container Apps or AWS EC2.** Deliberately open. Both host the same
docker-compose stack; the difference is what the artifact demonstrates and what it costs to
keep alive during a job search.

| | Azure Container Apps | AWS EC2 t4g.small |
|---|---|---|
| Cost | Free grant, scale-to-zero | ~$22–27/mo, always on |
| Ops surface | Managed; no box to patch | Full control; you run the box |
| Postgres | Needs a managed DB or a sidecar with a volume | Runs in the same compose file |
| Cold start | Real, on scale-to-zero — bad for a recruiter clicking a link | None |
| Signals | Containers, managed platform | AWS + Docker + CI/CD, currently claimed with no artifact behind them |

Decided by: whether the demo must answer instantly on a cold click, and whether the AWS
signal is worth the monthly cost. Not blocking — everything upstream of deployment is
identical either way.

## Deviations from the spec — deliberate, with reasons



**2. `doc_type` extended.** The spec's literals are `policy | endorsement | bulletin | guide`.
The scriptable backbone is regulations and statutes, which fit none of them. Extended to
`policy | endorsement | bulletin | guide | regulation | statute`.





**5. `token_count` uses one designated reference tokenizer, not tiktoken.** The spec says
tiktoken; that is OpenAI's BPE and mis-counts for both encoders under test. It cannot be "the
embedding model's tokenizer" either, now that there are two — chunk boundaries must be
**identical** across both, or the bake-off in Deviation 8 confounds chunking with encoding.
`Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B`'s tokenizer is the reference, `token_count` targets the 400–800 band
against it, and both encoders then embed byte-identical chunks.

**6. A local cross-encoder, not Cohere Rerank.** The spec offers either. Cohere needs an API
key, which breaks "clone the repo and reproduce the retrieval table." Each bi-encoder is
paired with its own family's reranker — `Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B` or `bge-reranker-v2-m3` — so the
comparison is family against family, never a mixed pipeline.

**7. A web-search tier, beyond the spec — late, and outside the measured path.** See the
citation contract below. It sits after refusal, never inside it, and is disabled during every
eval run.

**8. Two bi-encoders carried into the ablation, not one.** The spec assumes a single embedding
model. Published scores put `Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B` at **61.83** on MTEB English v2 Retrieval.
BAAI publishes no comparable figure for `bge-m3`; its aggregate (~63.0) sits just under
`bge-large-en-v1.5` (64.23 aggregate, 54.29 Retrieval), which suggests m3 trails by roughly
7–11 points on English. **That is an inference, not a measurement**, and none of those numbers
were taken on regulation text. Both models are ~0.6B and ~560 MB at int8, both fit a 2 GB box,
and the corpus is ~1,500 chunks — so carrying both costs compute we already have, and settles
the question with our own number instead of someone else's citation.

`bge-large-en-v1.5` is excluded on a measurement rather than a preference. **38% of SABS
sections exceed its 512-token cap, and those sections hold 76% of the text**: s.3(1)
definitions runs 3,417 tokens, General Exclusions 1,553, and the median `"does not apply"`
section 671. A 512 ceiling makes "one clause, one chunk" unimplementable across the 400–800
band this project exists to demonstrate — and it would truncate the clause-aware rows while
leaving the 512-token baseline row intact, handicapping the arm under test.

## Citation and disclosure contract

Applies to every answer the system produces. Decided up front because it constrains the chunk
schema, the agent's output format, the UI, and the eval harness at once.

### Every corpus citation renders provenance, not just a locator

```
O. Reg. 34/10, s. 31(1)(a) — Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule
Consolidated 2026-07-01 · ontario.ca/laws/regulation/100034
Not an official version.
```

The chain is `Chunk.doc_id` → manifest row → `source_url`, `citation`, `consolidation_date`,
`status`, `licence_note`. No new storage; the manifest already carries all of it.

- **`status` is a safety field, not bookkeeping.** A chunk from a revoked document must render
  a revoked badge. e-Laws serves revoked regulations at live URLs with no structural marker —
  if the citation does not say so, nothing does.
- **`consolidation_date` tells the reader the law may have moved** since indexing.
- **FSRA PDFs are linked, never rehosted.** Serve the extracted citation plus a link to the
  original; `licence_note` on those rows says "verify per document."

### "Not advice" is a licence term, not boilerplate

King's Printer permits free reproduction **on condition** that the copy states it is not an
official version. So the disclaimer is simultaneously the spec's product decision and a
compliance requirement — which is a better answer than "we added a footer."

Rendered in three places: per citation ("not an official version"), per answer ("document
retrieval, not advice"), and in the interface chrome. Never phrase an answer as a
recommendation; always attach verifiable citations; surface uncertainty explicitly.

### Three answer states, not two

| State | Rendering | Counted in evals? |
|---|---|---|
| **Answered from corpus** | clause locator + source URL + consolidation date + licence line | yes — recall@5, exclusion recall |
| **Not in corpus** (refusal) | "this corpus does not address that" | yes — **false-answer rate** |
| **Public sources say…** | visually distinct block, URL + retrieval date, **no clause locator**, marked unverified and not exclusion-checked | **no** |

State 3 layers *on top of* state 2 — the refusal still fires and is still tested. This is the
whole reason the web tier is safe to add: it cannot mask a refusal, because the refusal is
what it renders beneath.
